JBlox is a furthermore improved version of my previous Minecraft inspired project, Cubic3D. Cubic3D was entirely built upon Display Lists, from which I managed to get some pretty decent performance readings. I decided to abandon Cubic3D because I wanted to digg deeper into OpenGL and use the newer rendering methods, like VBO (Vertex Buffer Object), but mainly because of the poor structure of the project.
